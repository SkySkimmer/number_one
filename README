Perfect play AI for BvS Number One (animecubed.com/billy)

Requirements:

Some version of lp_solve
A compiler with decent C++11 support

Instructions (for Ubuntu Linux)

$ sudo apt-get install liblpsolve55-dev build-essential
$ make -f Makefile.ubuntu

Instructions (Any unix-ish system)
Get the appropriate dev package from the lp_solve Sourceforge and uncompress it into this folder.
If you can't find one, grab the src package and build it.
Change <lpsolve/lp_lib.h> in zs_wrap.cc to "lp_lib.h"
For 64-bit systems using 32-bit lp_solve, edit Makefile.ubuntu as follows:
  Add the line LDFLAGS = -m32 to the top
  Add -m32 after -std=c++11
$ make

Instructions (Windows)

Don't. :D


Important functions:

game_state.cc:act() implements the actual game mechanics
zs_wrap.cc:zs_solve_() solves a zero-sum game as a linear program
number_one_main.cc:moonburst_loop() runs the input loop
eval_state.cc:eval_state() calculates the probability of winning
              get_strat() prints a move chosen from subgame perfect equilibrium
              distribution
              get_doubletime_strat() does what you'd expect.
